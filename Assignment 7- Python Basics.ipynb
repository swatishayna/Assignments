    "\n",
    "Answer: re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: If the search is successful, search() returns a match object or None otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "Answer: re.match() returns regexobject only if the pattern is present at the starting of the string.using group()\n",

    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
