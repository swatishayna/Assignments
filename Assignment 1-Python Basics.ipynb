    "1. What are the differences between operators and values in the following?\n",
    "*\n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "-\n",
    "/\n",
    "+\n",
    "6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer1: Operators works on operands(values) to perform calculations. They are especial characters like * - / + for multiplication, substraction, for quotient and addition respectively etc. In simple words they perform logical and arithmatic operations. Values are operands on which these operators operates like \"hello\",87.8, 6 etc\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    " spam\n",
    "'spam'\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer2: String is a data type in Python enclosed in \"\"  or ''. Where as variable are used to store data, they reserve memory            for the data in computer system.\n",
    "         Here spam is an example of variable and \"spam\" is an example of string data data type\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 3: Majorly we have three type:\n",
    "a)Int:  discrete values of numbers, example 22,87,98 etc\n",
    "b)Float: They are decimal numbers like 4.0, 44.51672, etc\n",
    "c)string: Anything enclosed in \"\" is treated as string, example: \"4.0\",\"3\", \"ineuron\", \"True\",\"T\", etc\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer4: Logical/valid combination of operands and operators are called expressions. They are meant to perform computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In this chapter, assignment statements such as spam = 10 were added. What's the difference between a declaration and an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:There is not any hard code for declaration in python. Howsoever during assignment python on its own decide the data type and reserves a memory for the data. In expression we use data explicitly or we fetch from the memory locations and perform calculations on it. \n",
    "ex: a=50  is an example of assignment\n",
    "a+6 is an example of expression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer6: 23\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer7: 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "         'spamspamspam'\n",
    "         Output will be same\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 is not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Variable Naming Convention does not allow to have a variable name a number or starting with a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Which of the following three functions may be used to convert a value to an integer, a floating-point number, or a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: int(), float() and str() is used convert convert a value to an integer, a floating-point number, or a string.\n",
    "There are certain limitations for example int(\"a\") will throw ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'. And same goes with float as we do some arithmatic operations on numbers(int/float) only. This conversion of one data type into another is known as typecasting. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the error caused by this expression? What would you do about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: a) TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "        b) 'I have eaten ' + \"99\" + ' burritos.' is valid\n"
