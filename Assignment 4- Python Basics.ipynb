This makes the changes visible in the original object as well if there is any change is made in the new compound object. copy.deepcopy() is used for deep copy in which it creates a new compound object and then inserts the copy of the original compound object. This makes the changes doesnt visible in the original object if there is any change is made in the new compound object. both are relevent only for compound object.\n"
