    "1. What are the Boolean data type's two values? How do you go about writing them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: True and False are two values of Boolean data type. They are mainly used to check conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: a) and- returns True only when both the inputs are true in all other cases it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "        b) or - returns True if any of two condition or both the conditions are True and False in other case\n",
    "        \n",
    "        c) not- returns True if its operand is a false expression and returns false if it is true.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: a)False and False = False\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)\n",
    "not (5 > 4)\n",
    "(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)\n",

    "(True and True) and (True == False)\n",
    "(not False) or (not True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "a)    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)------------------------- False\n",
    "\n",
    "b)    not (5 > 4)-----------------------------------False\n",
    "\n",
    "c)    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)---------------------------True\n",

    "5. What are the six different types of reference operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: a) assignment b)logical c)bitwise d)comparison e)arithmatic f)Identity g)membership \n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Assignment operator is used to assign/store value/data to any variable/memory location of computer on the other hand equal to operator is used to check equality of LHS and RHS, the output to which is either True or False. \n",
    "Example: a=10 is an example of assignment and a==b is an example of equal to operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:Conditions are logical statements and the next lines gets executed only if the provided condition is True so in simple language they are the gateways to next line of codes/block of codes.\n",

    "\n",
    "11. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "break statement terminate the loop when the condition gets true on the other hand continue statement terminates the current iteration and sends the control to the loop block for next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "Answer: Range is a generator function.The first two are same. The last one will throw same output but the the third argument is the step number. \n",
    "Ex list(range(0,10,1)) will return [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] where as list(range(0,10,4)) will give [0,4,8]\n",
